# Bionic Ape S.L.

# MetaVersus World

We are currently working on implementing features from MetaSuite and updating to Unreal Engine 5

###Features from MetaSuite

1. User Authentication
2. Character Creation
3. Cleaning Blueprint code and translating it into C++

###Updating the project to Unreal Engine 5


## Player Authentication

We are integrating the current authentication via Cognito to implement the interfaces of OnlineSubsystem. The Engine is fully integrated with this set of interfaces and other systems such as Epic Games, Steam, iOS, Android or Facebook make use of this set of Interfaces implemented in one Moudule.

## Character Creation Integration

- Translate Character Editor to Character Creation in C++.
- Easy Backend Communication (via JSON)
- No ingame Loading time
- Agnostic Components that aren't dependent on the Actor
- Facilitates future integration with NFTs
- Ready Player Me Integration

## Worlds

- Fashion World
- 

## Product Release Stage: 
Closed alpha (Q4 2022)

## Build: UnrealEngine 5

## UE5 core features:

# Lumen
Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system that is designed for next-generation

# Nanite

Unreal Engine 5's virtualized geometry system which uses a new internal mesh format and rendering technology to render pixel scale detail and high object counts. It intelligently does work on only the detail that can be perceived and no more. Nanite's data format is also highly compressed, and supports fine-grained streaming with automatic level of detail.
